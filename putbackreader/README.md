This wraps an io.Reader, giving you the option to "put back" bytes that were already read once, so that they may be read again.  I use this in conseption in conjuction with json.Decoder Buffered()
// call, which gives me the option of manipulating the stream after an error.  This is mainly used with with json-like serial input where a separator character is used, which pisses the json decoder right off.
